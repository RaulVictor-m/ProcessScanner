An API to make it simpler to automate hacking into others programs memory, to modify things such as score values, item count or really what ever you want, I made a simple example which keeps changing the color of my DS4 controller light by changing the RAM of the WindowsDS4 app



Its really simple to use the header file itself should guide you to what it can do 

still a work in progress, and I would love any help or suggestion
